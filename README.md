# CM_Summer2018
Jacky Tang, assessment for Critical Mass summer internship

### Work/Project Examples:
  1. Top6/Next! My first Android app
    - Taught myself Android in summer 2017 in an effort to understand the basics of the platform
        - https://github.com/jickay/Top6
  2. Degree Navigator (In progress)
    - A personal project made with MeteorJS to visually navigate through courses and prerequisites for different certifications ranging from a High School Diploma to a University Degree. Hope is to make course planning easier and to give a broader perspective on potential paths.

  3. Matching Algorithm, Java class assignment
    - Lead a group to develop an algorithm to find best matches between 2 sets given a set of constraints. Managed team progress, delagated tasks, managed versions, developed half of functionality, and debugged most of the errors.

### Inspiration:
  1. Small game demonstrating the safety of self driving cars:
    - This game is deceptively simple, yet wholly effective at illustrating the point very poignantly by comparing user input with automated controls. There are no tricks in the game to force the point. The undeniable truth is self-evident in its design.

  2. Data visualizations for the sexes in the workplace: 
    - The design of the visualizations show a strong point in an intuitive way. I always admire when vast amounts of data can be transformed into something easy to digest and makes a strong statement just through its form. Also a bonus for using pretty, but not gender-stereotyped colours.

  3. Meteor Javascript platform:
    - This is a full-stack JS platform that feels more unified and streamlined. It allows the developer to work on the front-end and the back-end simultaneously. While it has some flaws, I appreciate efforts to integrate different parts of development into a singular folow, rather than having to shift between different parts one by one.
